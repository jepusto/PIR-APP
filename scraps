In some contexts, the researcher may have prior knowledge about one or more characteristics of the behavior stream; for instance, it may be known that the average event duration is unlikely to be more than 15 s. 

For computational and notational purposes, it will be useful to parameterize the process using $\phi, \rho$, where $\rho = \zeta c / \phi (1 - \phi)$ and the constant $c$ is defined in what follows. 

It is interesting to note that, under the Alternating Poisson Process, PIR observations follow a counting process on the space of non-negative integers. To see this, we re-express the observations in terms of the number of consecutive intervals in which behavior is observed. Let $V_k = k - \max\{1 \leq j \leq k: U_j = 0\}$ and observe that if $V_{k-1} = i$, then $V_k \in \{0, i + 1\}$ with probability one. Furthermore, \[
\Pr\left(V_k = i + 1 | V_{k-1} = i\right) = 
\]

Despite its limitations, there appears to be very little practical drawback to using the PLEs in place of the MTS proportion estimates. Unless the behavior is happening very infrequently, the PLE provides comparable estimates of prevalence. Even when the approximately unbiased estimates of incidence are difficult to obtain, the estimates of prevalence are nearly always still approximately unbiased. If an applied researcher is careful and aware of those instances where incidence estimates may not be trustworthy, we would argue that the PLE is superior to other known methods of obtaining MTS estimates.

In order to characterize the implications of using the proposed priors, it is useful to consider the values of the PLEs that result from extreme configurations of the data. For example, the PLEs from an observation session in which the entire MTS record is equal to zero (i.e., $X_0 = X_1 = \cdots = X_K = 0$) will be approximately equal to \[
\tilde\zeta_{MTS} = \frac{1}{\theta_\lambda \left(\alpha_\mu + \alpha_\lambda - 2\right)}, \quad \tilde\phi_{MTS} = \frac{\alpha_\mu - 1}{\alpha_\mu + \alpha_\lambda - 2 + K}. \]
Using PIR with $d = 0$, the PLEs from an observation session in which the entire PIR record is equal to zero ($U_1 = U_2 = \cdots = U_K = 0$) will be approximately equal to \[
\tilde\zeta_{PIR} = \frac{1}{2K}\left[\sqrt{(\alpha_\mu + \alpha_\lambda - 2)^2 + \frac{4K}{\theta_\lambda}} - \left(\alpha_\mu + \alpha_\lambda - 2\right)\right], \quad \tilde\phi_{PIR} = \frac{\alpha_\mu - 1}{\alpha_\mu - 1 + \alpha_\lambda + K\hat\zeta}.\]
