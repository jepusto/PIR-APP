An Alternating Poisson Process model for estimating prevalence and incidence from interval recording data

1. Introduction
- Measures of directly observed behavior are used in many areas of psychological research, behavioral time series data.
- Systematic observation procedures
- Systematic bias of usual summaries of interval recording data
- Related work
  - Brown, Solomon, & Stephens (1977)
  - Suen & Ary
  - penalized likelihood

2. Alternating Poisson Process
- Behavior stream model

3. Momentary Time Sampling
- MTS observation filter
- Likelihood (BSS)
- Penalized likelihood estimators
- Simulation evidence

4. Interval Recording
- PIR observation filter
- Likelihood
- Penalized likelihood estimators
- Simulation evidence
- Whole interval recording

5. Application
- Johnson data?

6. Discussion
- Need to extend to regression models
- Limitation to state-behaviors where prevalence is relevant. Need for further methods for estimating incidence of instant-behaviors from PIR.
- Model does not explicitly account for observer errors in scoring. Need for methods of assessing the extent of such error.
- Potential for new recording procedures that combine MTS, PIR, and WIR
